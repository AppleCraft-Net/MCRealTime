Love community,

 

I have once again brought out a plugin, which allows the real-time in Minecraft. That means, if e.g. 8pm, it's the same night in Minecraft, the other way around. This plugin works according to the CMOS system. The plugin gets the time information from the CMOS and transfers that live to Minecraft.

 

You do not have to do much to get the plugin working. Just put the plugin in the normal plugins folder. This also applies to the users who use BungeeCord!

 

Now you have to change the game rule in all worlds that you own (for the BungeeCord users also the subserver), so that the time in

Minecraft no longer moved independently, but only controlled by the plugin. Simply use the following command:

 

"/gamerule doDaylightCycle false".



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Here are maybe important commands:



"/info" - You will get news and status about this plugin.



"/contact" - You will get information about my contact details, if you have a problem or if you will send a feedback for my plugin.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

The only one complication is, that you can not execute the /time set <time> command !

 

That's it, now you can fully enjoy the plugin.

 

I wish you a lot of fun with my plugin!
